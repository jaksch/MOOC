	What is a graph:
		Graph = (V, E)
		V is a set of vertices (synonym: nodes)
		E is a set of edges; each edge is a pair (v_source, v_target) and edges may be directed or
		undirected
		
	Basic graph metrics:
		|V|, |E|
		|E| is more interesting than |V|
		in-degree(v), out-degree(v)
		
	Exponential distribution:
		Random graph has exponential distribution (not common in real life)
		Best seen when is on a log scale
	
	Zipf distribution: (power law distribution)
		Often human-generated data (as letters in alphabet, words in vocabulary ect.)
		Best seen in a log-log scale
		
	Diameter in a graph:
		Longest of all shortest paths
		
	Connectivity Coefficient:
		Minimum number of vertices you need to remove that will disconnect the graph
		
	Centrality:
