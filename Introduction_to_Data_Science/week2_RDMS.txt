	Sets vs. bags; sets don't contain duplicates where bags can contain duplicates.
	
	WHERE in SQL -> "select" in RA
	SELECT in SQL -> "project" in RA
	
	"select" (RA) selects rows from a table
	"project" (RA) eliminates columns from a table
	
	SQL example from single relation; R(subject, predicate, object) (Resource Description Framework 
	(RDF) data):
	
		SELECT r1.subject
		FROM R r1, R r2, R r3
		WHERE r1.predicate = "knows"
		AND r2.predicate = "holdsAccount"
		AND r3.predicate = "accountHomepage"
		AND r1.object = r2.subject
		AND r2.object = r3.subject;

	Views:
		A view is a query with a name:
		
		CREATE VIEW StorePrice AS
		SELECT x.store, y.price
		FROM Purchase x, Product y
		WHERE x.pid = y.pid
		
		This is like a new table StorePrice(store, price), that can be used in other queries.
