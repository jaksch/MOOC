Mining of Massive Datasets Quiz Week 3

## Question 1
For the following graph:

![Network 1](figures/quiz_week3_img1.gif)

Write the adjacency matrix A, the degree matrix D, and the Laplacian matrix L. For each, find the sum of all entries and the number of nonzero entries.

### Solution
```{r}
## nodes in the graph
nodes1 <- LETTERS[1:8]

## the adjacency matrix for the graph
adjacency1 <- matrix(c(0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,
                     0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,
                     1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,
                     0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,
                     0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,
                     1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,
                     0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,
                     0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0), nrow = 8, ncol = 8, byrow = FALSE, 
                     dimnames = list(nodes1, nodes1))
adjacency1

## the degree matrix for the graph
nof_degree <- apply(adjacency1, 2, sum)
degree1 <- diag(nof_degree)
colnames(degree1) <- nodes1
rownames(degree1) <- nodes1
degree1

## the laplacian matrix for the graph
laplacian1 <- degree1 - adjacency1
laplacian1

## sum of all entries
sum(degree1)
sum(adjacency1)
sum(laplacian1)

## number of nonzero entries
sum(degree1 != 0)
sum(adjacency1 != 0)
sum(laplacian1 != 0)
```


## Question 2
You are given the following graph.

![Network 1](figures/quiz_week3_img2.gif)

The goal is to find two clusters in this graph using Spectral Clustering on the Laplacian matrix. Compute the Laplacian of this graph. Then compute the second eigen vector of the Laplacian (the one corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue).

To cluster the points, we decide to split at the mean value. We say that a node is a tie if its value in the eigen-vector is exactly equal to the mean value. Let's assume that if a point is a tie, we choose its cluster at random.

### Solution
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

## nodes in the graph
nodes2 <- 1:6

## the adjacency matrix for the graph
adjacency2 <- matrix(c(0,1,1,0,0,0,
                       1,0,0,1,0,1,
                       1,0,0,1,0,0,
                       0,1,1,0,1,0,
                       0,0,0,1,0,1,
                       0,1,0,0,1,0), nrow = 6, ncol = 6, byrow = FALSE, 
                     dimnames = list(nodes2, nodes2))
adjacency2

## the degree matrix for the graph
nof_degree <- apply(adjacency2, 2, sum)
degree2 <- diag(nof_degree)
colnames(degree2) <- nodes2
rownames(degree2) <- nodes2
degree2

## the laplacian matrix for the graph
laplacian2 <- degree2 - adjacency2
laplacian2

## find eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eig <- eigen(laplacian2)
eig

## lambda_2
eig_val <- rev(eig$values)[2]
eig_val

## and the corresponding eigenvector
eig_vec <- eig$vectors[,5]
eig_vec
sum(eig_vec)

plot_data <- data.frame(rank = 1:6,
                        value = sort(eig_vec))
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x=rank, y=value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

So nodes 1 and 3 are in the same cluster.
Nodes 5 and 6 are in the same cluster.
And nodes 2 and 4 are ties.
