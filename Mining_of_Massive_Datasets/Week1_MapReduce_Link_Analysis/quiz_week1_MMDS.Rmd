Mining of Massive Datasets Quiz Week 1

## Question 1
Consider three Web pages with the following links:

![Network 1](figures/quiz_week1_img1.gif)

Suppose we compute PageRank with a $\beta$ of 0.7, and we introduce the additional constraint that the sum of the PageRanks of the three pages must be 3, to handle the problem that otherwise any multiple of a solution will also be a solution. Compute the PageRanks a, b, and c of the three pages A, B, and C, respectively.

Note that this graph contains no 'Dead Ends' but a single 'Spider Trap' (node C).

### Solution

The transition matrix for the graph is:
```{r}
beta <- 0.7
M <- matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5, 0,0,1, 0,0,1), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = list(c("A", "B", "C"),c("A", "B", "C")))
M
```

PageRank for node $j$ is calculated as:
$$r_{j} = \sum_{i \to j}\beta\frac{r_i}{d_i} + (1-\beta)\frac{1}{n}$$
where $d_i$ is the out-degree of node $i$. The same expressed in matrix formulation:
$$A=\beta M + (1-\beta)\frac{1}{n}e \cdot e^{T}$$
where $n$ is the number of nodes and $e$ is an unit vector of length $n$.

This calculation assumes that $M$ is stochastic, aperiodic and irreducible. $A$ is also called the Google matrix.

The actural computation of the pageRank is a iterative process where
for each iteration we calculate $r_{new} = A \cdot r_{old}$ untill it converges

```{r}
n <- 3 ## number of nodes
init <- rep(1/n, n)
rank_old <- init
epsilon <- 0.00005

for(iter in 1:100) {
  rank <- ((beta * M) %*% rank_old) + ((1-beta) * rep(1/n, n))
  print(paste('iteration', iter))
  print(rank)
  if(sum(abs(rank-rank_old)) < epsilon) {break}
  rank_old <- rank
}
```

And because there is the constraint that the sum of the PageRanks of the three pages must be 3 we multipli the resualt with 3 to get the final solution to the question.
```{r}
solution1 <- rank*3
solution1
```


## Question 2
Consider three Web pages with the following links:

![Network 2](figures/quiz_week1_img2.gif)

Suppose we compute PageRank with $\beta$=0.85. Write the equations for the PageRanks a, b, and c of the three pages A, B, and C, respectively.

Note that this graph don't contains 'Dead Ends' or 'Spider Traps'.

### Solution

The transition matrix for the graph is:
```{r}
beta <- 0.85
M <- matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5, 0,0,1, 1,0,0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = list(c("A", "B", "C"),c("A", "B", "C")))
M
```

I will use the same technique as in question 1.
```{r}
n <- 3 ## number of nodes
init <- rep(1/n, n)
rank_old <- init
epsilon <- 0.00005

for(iter in 1:100) {
  rank <- ((beta * M) %*% rank_old) + ((1-beta) * rep(1/n, n))
  print(paste('iteration', iter))
  print(rank)
  if(sum(abs(rank-rank_old)) < epsilon) {break}
  rank_old <- rank
}
```


## Question 3
Consider three Web pages with the following links:

![Network 2](figures/quiz_week1_img2.gif)

Assuming no "taxation," compute the PageRanks a, b, and c of the three pages A, B, and C, using iteration, starting with the "0th" iteration where all three pages have rank a = b = c = 1. Compute as far as the 5th iteration, and also determine what the PageRanks are in the limit. 

### Solution

The graph and therefore the transition matrix is the same as for question 2:
```{r}
M <- matrix(c(0,0.5,0.5, 0,0,1, 1,0,0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = list(c("A", "B", "C"),c("A", "B", "C")))
M
```

The constrain in this question is that there is no 'tax-ation', so we need to calculate the rank without $\beta$.
We also have to save the 5'th iteration.

```{r}
n <- 3 ## number of nodes
init <- rep(1, n)
rank_old <- init
epsilon <- 0.00005

for(iter in 1:100) {
  rank <- M %*% rank_old
  print(paste('iteration', iter))
  print(rank)
  
  if(iter == 5) {iter_5 <- rank}
  
  if(sum(abs(rank-rank_old)) < epsilon) {break}
  rank_old <- rank
}
```
