Practical Machine Learning

	** Week 4 - More Prediction Models **
	
	Regularized regression:
		Pros: can help with bias/variance tradeoff (slightly bias your model but reduce the 
		variance), can help with model selection (like LASSO)
		Cons: can be computationally demanding on large data sets, does not perform as well as
		random forest and boosting
		
	Combining predictors (model ensemble):
		Build an odd numer of models.
		See R package caretEnsemble (but it is in development so use at your own risk!)
		
	Forecasting (time series data):
		Look after; trends, seasonal or cycles.
		use function decompose() in R on time series to inspect for trends, seasonal and random 
		patterns.
