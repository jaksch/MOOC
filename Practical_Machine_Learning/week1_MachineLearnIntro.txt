Practical Machine Learning

	** Week 1 - Machine Learning Introduction **
	
	Issues to consider:
		Machine learning methods to be interpretable, simple, accurate, fast and scalable.
		
	Tradeoffs:
		Interpretability vs. accuracy
		Speed vs. accuracy
		Simplicity vs. accuracy
		Scalability vs. accuracy
		
	Know the benchmarks!
	
	Rules of thumbs for predicting study design:
		60% training
		20% test
		20% validation
		
	Types of errors:
		Sensitivity 				-> 	P(pos. test | disease)		=	TP/(TP+FN)
			(if you want few missed positives)
		Specificity 				-> 	P(neg. test | no disease)	=	TN/(GP+TN)
			(If you want few negatives called positives)
		Positive Predictive Value 	-> 	P(disease | pos. test)		=	TP/(TP+FP)
		Negative Predictive Value	-> 	P(no disease |neg. test)	=	TN/(FN+TN)
		Accuracy					-> 	P(correct outcome)			=	(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN)
		
	ROC curve:
		X axis: 1-Specificity -> P(FP)
		Y axis: Sensitivity -> P(TP)
		
	Cross Validation:
		Random sampling:
			Must be done without replacement
			Random smapling with replacement is called bootstrap => underestimates of the error			
		K-fold: 
			Larger k => less bias, more variance
			Smaller k => more bias, less variance
		Leave-one-out is k-fold with n folds.
