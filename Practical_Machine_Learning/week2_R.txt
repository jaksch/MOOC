Practical Machine Learning

	** Week 2 - R **
	
	R functions for plotting:
		FeaturePlot(... , plot='pairs') (caret package)
		cut2 (Hmisc package)
		grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2) (ggplot2(?) package)
		prop.table(table.name, 1)
		
	R functions for covariate creation:
		nearZero(data = ..., saveMetrics = TRUE) (caret package)
		spline basis: bs(..., df = 3) (splines package)
		
	Always create from the training set and use the same values to create in the test set.
	That means that all exploration and model creation and feature building has to happen in the 
	training set.
	
	Trick to colour different points on plot:
		((spam$type == 'spam')*1 + 1)
